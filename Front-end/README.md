# KAPFrontEnd - Clinical Application Frontend

Welcome to the KAPFrontEnd repository, the frontend component of the Klinisches Anwendungsprojekt (Clinical Application Project). This project is built with 
React, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the clinical data resources served by the [backend server](https://github.com/aaron3636/KAP).

## Getting Started

To get started with the KAPFrontEnd, follow these steps:

1. **Clone / Start the server:**
   - Follow the steps provided [here](https://github.com/aaron3636/KAP) to clone and start the backend server.
   - Alternatively, you can download the built and ready-to-use server directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pery1-VEiU5qInV35zOIW4Vb3jjmPfdU?usp=drive_link).

2. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aaron3636/KAPFrontEnd.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:** Start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

By following these steps, you will have both the backend server and the frontend application up and running, enabling seamless interaction with the clinical data resources. Should you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy testing!
## Available Scripts

In the KAPFrontEnd project directory, you can use the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload automatically if you make edits.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Use this for testing your application.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The production build is optimized for better performance.

- `npm run eject`: This is a one-way operation and should be used with caution. It allows you to have full control over the build tool and configuration choices. Note that this is not recommended for small and middle deployments.
